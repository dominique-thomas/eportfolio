    about: `Hi, I'm <span class="textEmphasis">Dominique</span>!<br><br>
            I'm an <span class="textEmphasis">instructional designer</span> who blends creativity, technology, and clarity to build meaningful learning experiences.<br><br>

            With 12+ years of experience, I've developed eLearning, simulations, and interactive content that simplify complex ideas and keep learners engaged. My focus is using <span class="textEmphasis">practical design and emerging tools</span> to make learning both effective and memorable.<br><br>

            When I'm not designing, you'll find me experimenting with new tech, exploring UI/UX, or coding small side projects just to see what's possible. I'm always learning, always creating, and always curious about what's next. Want to learn more about me or collaborate on a project?`,
